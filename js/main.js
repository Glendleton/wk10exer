// first step4)Create three objects with four properties (one must be an image file path) using object literal notation.

// step5)Create the same three objects, with the same four properties, using constructor notation.

// step6)Add to a method to each literal object. The method should tmultiply two numbers and return the product.

// step7)Add the same method to your constructor function.

// step8)Add each object created by the constructor function to an array.

// step9)Loop through the array of objects. Create an element for each property so you have a place to display each piece of information.

// step10)Still in the loop, create individual text nodes for each piece of information. Add these text nodes to the elements you created.

// step11)Still in the loop, update the source and alt attributes of the image.

// step12)in html

// step13)Still in the loop, finally add the contianer to the HTML so the user can view the content.
